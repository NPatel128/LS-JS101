# Truthiness
- AND (&&)
  - Only true if both sides are true
  - Goes left to right unless there are ()
  - Will short circuit to false if anything evaluates to false
- OR (||)
  - Only false if both sides are false
  - Short circuites to true if anything comes back as true.
- Short Circuits
  - After an expression short circuts it will stop looking at the code for the rest of the expression.
  - JS knows that since the expression has a short in it that it has to evaluate to true or false no matter what
    - For AND it is false if anything eval to false since AND has to be true on both sides to be true.
    - For OR is is true if anything eval to true since OR has to be false on both sides to be false.
- Truthiness
  - Everything but these 6 things are true:
    - False
    - Undefined
    - Null
    - 0
    - "" (Empty String)
    - NaN (Not a number)
  - ALL FALSE - MEMORIZE!
