- Flow Charts help us map out the logical sequence of a possible solution. 
- Shapes of a flowchart:
  - Oval - Start / Stop
  - Rectangle - Processing Stop
  - Parallelogram - Input / Output
  - Diamond - Decision

- A diamond (decision) can not have more than 2 branches. 
  - If you need more than 2 branches then have seperate diamonds.
